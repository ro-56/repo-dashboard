# To Tickets

Break a plan, spec, or conversation into a set of **tickets** — tracer-bullet vertical slices, each declaring the tickets that **block** it. Tickets are published via `taskr`.

## Process

### 1. Gather context

Work from whatever is already in the conversation context. If the user passes a reference (a ticket ID or path) as an argument, fetch it with `taskr show <id>` and read its full body.

### 2. Explore the codebase (optional)

If you have not already explored the codebase, do so to understand the current state of the code. Ticket titles and descriptions should use the project's domain glossary vocabulary, and respect ADRs in the area you're touching.

Look for opportunities to prefactor the code to make the implementation easier. "Make the change easy, then make the easy change."

### 3. Draft vertical slices

Break the work into **tracer bullet** tickets.

<vertical-slice-rules>

- Each slice cuts a narrow but COMPLETE path through every layer (schema, API, UI, tests) — vertical, NOT a horizontal slice of one layer
- A completed slice is demoable or verifiable on its own
- Each slice is sized to fit in a single fresh context window
- Any prefactoring should be done first

</vertical-slice-rules>

Give each ticket its **blocking edges** — the other tickets that must complete before it can start.

**Wide refactors are the exception to vertical slicing.** A **wide refactor** is one mechanical change — rename a column, retype a shared symbol — whose **blast radius** fans across the whole codebase, so a single edit breaks thousands of call sites at once and no vertical slice can land green. Don't force it into a tracer bullet; sequence it as **expand–contract**. First expand: add the new form beside the old so nothing breaks. Then migrate the call sites over in batches sized by blast radius (per package, per directory), each batch its own ticket blocked by the expand, keeping CI green batch to batch because the old form still exists. Finally contract: delete the old form once no caller remains, in a ticket blocked by every migrate batch. When even the batches can't stay green alone, keep the sequence but let them share an integration branch that all block a final integrate-and-verify ticket — green is promised only there.

### 4. Quiz the user

Present the proposed breakdown as a numbered list. For each ticket, show:

- **Title**: short descriptive name
- **Blocked by**: which other tickets (if any) must complete first
- **What it delivers**: the end-to-end behaviour this ticket makes work

Ask the user:

- Does the granularity feel right? (too coarse / too fine)
- Are the blocking edges correct — does each ticket only depend on tickets that genuinely gate it?
- Should any tickets be merged or split further?

Iterate until the user approves the breakdown.

### 5. Publish via taskr

Ensure taskr is initialized (`taskr init` — safe to re-run).

Create tickets in dependency order (blockers first) so each ticket's ID is available for linking:

```bash
# Create each ticket
taskr add "<title>" --type task --mode afk --body "<description with acceptance criteria>"

# Link dependencies (dependent blocks until depends-on is closed)
taskr link <dependent-id> <depends-on-id>

# Link to the task epic (if any)
taskr relate <original-reference-id> <new-ticket-id>
```

Task relations are directed: `taskr relate <from> <to>` means "from" is a subtask of "to". The epic is the original reference ticket, and each new ticket is a subtask of it.

For each ticket's `--body`, include:

- **What to build** — the end-to-end behaviour from the user's perspective
- **Acceptance criteria** — as a markdown checklist

Avoid specific file paths or code snippets in the body — they go stale fast. Exception: if a prototype produced a snippet that encodes a decision more precisely than prose can (state machine, reducer, schema, type shape), inline it and note briefly that it came from a prototype.

### 6. Verify

Run `taskr ready` to confirm the unblocked tickets are correct, and `taskr dep-tree <id>` on the final ticket to confirm the full dependency graph looks right.
